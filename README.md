This project examines a set of 14,797 customers to determine which customer characteristics are associated with high income, defined as having income greater than $50,000. Key takeaways are as follows:

- 31.6% (3554) of records are of high-income earners.
- Only 6.35% of unmarried individuals are high-income earners.
- 75.6% of all customers with 14-16 years of are high-income earners versus only 21% of customers with 1-13 years of education, suggesting education level is positively correlated with
income.
- Most customers have an education level of between 9 and 10 years, with the third largest numberof records being 13 years.
- The proportion of males who are high-income earners (30.25%) is 2.6 times that of females who are high-income earners (11.5%).
- Male customers make up the majority of both high income and low-income earners, but there are twice as many records of males than of females.
